    <p>Ruth 4</p>
    <p>
        Now here is where the story takes a twist. 
        <br><br>
        In the morning Boaz went to the town gate. As family redeemer, Boaz 
        must find someone to redeem Ruth's family, by buying Naomi's land back 
        in Moab, and marrying Ruth. This person is called the family protector 
        - let's call him "Bob" (he doesn't have a name in the Bible).
        <br><br>
        So all the elders, Boaz and "Bob", the family protector, gather by 
        the town gate.
        <br><br>
        Then Boaz asks if "Bob" would buy the land that Naomi came from in 
        order to redeem them. "Bob" agrees. 
        <br><br>
        Boaz tells him that with the land comes a marriage vow with Ruth and 
        protection over her family - Naomi. "Bob" declines. 
        <br><br>   
    </p>

        <div class="verse">
            Ruth 4: 5-6 <br>
            Then Boaz said, "When you buy the property from Naomi, you must also 
            marry Ruth. She is from Moab and is the dead man's widow. So you must 
            marry her."
            <br><br>
            When the family protector heard that, he said, "Then I can't buy the 
            land. If I did, I might put my own property in danger."
        </div>

    <p>
        Then “Bob”, the family protector, takes off his sandal* and tells 
        Boaz to buy the land instead. So Boaz does just that, and in doing so 
        takes Ruth to be his wife, redeeming her family and restoring her family's 
        title through the land.

            *In earlier times in Israel when family land was bought and changed 
            owners one took off their sandal and placed it on the ground to 
            settle the matter.
