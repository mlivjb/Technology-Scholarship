    <h1>The Plagues of Egypt cont.</h1>
    <h2>Insights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Contrasting to the last plagues, God hardens Pharaoh's heart 
            instead of Pharaoh doing it himself. <br> <br>This is to show God’s almighty 
            power and to teach the Israelites that God’s plan may be different 
            to the plan of the Israelites - deliverance takes time. <br>
        </li>

            Boils are another skin disease like leprosy however they produce 
            massive bumps that are filled with pus; you can’t lie down and you 
            are always itchy.

    <p>Exodus 9 - 10</p>

    <h2>Plague of boils</h2>
    <p>
        Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, “Take handfuls of soot from a 
        furnace and have Moses toss it into the air in the presence of Pharaoh. 
        It will become fine dust over the whole land of Egypt, and festering 
        boils will break out on people and animals throughout the land.” <br><br>

        So they took soot from a furnace and stood before Pharaoh. Moses tossed 
        it into the air, and festering boils broke out on people and animals. <br><br>  

        The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils that 
        were on them and on all the Egyptians. But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s 
        heart and he would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the Lord had 
        said to Moses. <br><br>

    <h2>Plague of hail</h2>
    <p>
        Then the Lord said to Moses, “Get up early and say to Pharaoh, 
        ‘God says to: Let my people go, otherwise he will send the full force 
        of my plagues against you and against your officials and your people. <br><br>

        For by now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your 
        people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth. But I have 
        spared you for this very purpose, that I might show you my power. <br><br>

        You still set yourself against my people and will not let them go. 
        Therefore, I will send the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on Egypt, 
        from the day it was founded till now. <br><br>

        Bring your livestock and everything you have in the field to a place of 
        shelter, because the hail will fall on every person and animal that has 
        not been brought in, and they will die.’” <br><br>

        When Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, the Lord sent thunder 
        and hail, and lightning flashed down to the ground. <br><br>

        It was the worst storm in all the land of Egypt since it had become a 
        nation. The only place it did not hail was the land of Goshen, where the 
        Israelites were. <br><br>

        Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron. “This time I have sinned,” he 
        said to them. “The Lord is in the right, and I and my people are in the 
        wrong. Pray to the Lord, for we have had enough thunder and hail. 
        I will let you go; you don’t have to stay any longer.” <br><br>

        Then Moses left Pharaoh and went out of the city. He spread out his 
        hands toward the Lord; the thunder and hail stopped. When Pharaoh saw 
        that the storm had stopped, he and his officials hardened their hearts, 
        and he would not let the Israelites go. <br><br>

    </p>

    <h2>Plague of locusts</h2>
    <p>
        So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, “This is what the 
        Lord says: ‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? 
        Let my people go, so that they may worship me. <br><br>

        If you refuse to let them go, I will bring locusts into your country 
        tomorrow. They will cover the face of the ground so that it cannot be s
        een. They will devour what little you have left after the hail, including e
        very tree that is growing in your fields. They will fill your houses and 
        those of all your officials and all the Egyptians.’” <br><br>   

        Pharaoh’s officials said to him, “How long will this man be a snare to 
        us? Let the people go, so that they may worship the Lord their God. 
        Do you not yet realise that Egypt is ruined?” <br><br>

        And the Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over Egypt so that 
        locusts swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields, 
        everything left by the hail.” <br><br>

        So Moses stretched out his staff over Egypt. By morning the wind had 
        brought the locusts; they invaded all of Egypt and settled down in every 
        area of the country in great numbers. <br><br>

        Never before had there been such a plague of locusts, nor will there 
        ever be again. Nothing green remained on the trees or plants in all the 
        land of Egypt. <br><br>

        Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Forgive my sin 
        once more and pray to the Lord your God to take this deadly plague away 
        from me.” <br><br>

        And the Lord changed the wind which caught up the locusts and carried 
        them into the Red Sea. Not a locust was left anywhere in Egypt. 
        But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he would not let the 
        Israelites go. <br><br>
    </p>

    <h2>Plague of darkness</h2>
    <p>
        Then the Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky so 
        that darkness spreads over Egypt — darkness that can be felt.” <br><br>
        
        So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness 
        covered all Egypt for three days. <br><br>

        No one could see anyone else or move about for three days. Yet all the 
        Israelites had light in the places where they lived. <br><br>

        Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, “Go, worship the Lord. Even your 
        women and children may go with you; only leave your flocks and herds 
        behind.” <br><br>

        But Moses said, “Our livestock too must go with us; not a hoof is to 
        be left behind. We have to use some of them in worshipping the Lord our 
        God, and until we get there we will not know what we are to use to 
        worship the Lord.” <br> <br>

        But the Lord hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was not willing to 
        let them go. Pharaoh said to Moses, “Get out of my sight! Make sure you 
        do not appear before me again! The day you see my face you will die.” <br><br>

        “Just as you say,” Moses replied. “I will never appear before you again.”
