    <h1>The Plagues of Egypt</h1>
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
        When Moses arrived in Egypt he went to Pharaoh and Aaron spoke for him. 
        Moses performed the sign of his staff becoming a snake, however the 
        Egyptian magicians did the same thing with their magic and so Pharaoh's 
        heart was hard and he did not let the people go. So God sent plagues in 
        order to persuade Pharoah. 
    </p>

    <h2>Insights</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Pharaoh is stubborn and won’t let the people go. This shows 
            that God’s promises are kept as he said that Pharaoh would do that.
        </li> <br>
        <li>Every time that there is a plague Pharaoh begs Moses to get rid 
            of it in exchange for letting them go. But as soon as the plague 
            disappears he changes his mind. 
        </li> <br>
        <li>
            Moses and Aaron had to trust in God’s plan every time Pharaoh 
            would not let them go. They became very patient.
        </li> <br>
        <li>The bad thing about these plagues is that Egypt lived off the 
            livestock and their crops. As the plagues came their people starved. 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Exodus 7 - 9</p>
    <h2>Plague of blood</h2>
    <p>
        Then the Lord said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is unyielding; he 
        refuses to let the people go. <br><br>

        Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes out to the river. Tell Aaron, 
        ‘Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt — 
        over the streams and canals, over the ponds and all the reservoirs — 
        and they will turn to blood.’ Blood will be everywhere in Egypt, 
        even in vessels of wood and stone.” <br><br>

        Moses and Aaron did just as the Lord had commanded. The fish in the 
        Nile died, and the river smelled so bad that the Egyptians could not 
        drink its water. Blood was everywhere in Egypt. <br><br>

        But the Egyptian magicians did the same things by their secret arts, 
        and Pharaoh’s heart became hard; he would not listen to Moses and 
        Aaron, just as the Lord had said. <br><br>
    </p>

    <h2>Plague of frogs</h2>
    <p>
        Then the Lord said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, 
        ‘Let my people go, so that they may worship God. If you refuse to let 
        them go, he will send a plague of frogs on your whole country. <br><br>

        The Nile will teem with frogs. They will come up into your palace and 
        your bedroom and onto your bed. The frogs will come up on you and 
        your people and all your officials.’” <br><br>

        So Aaron stretched out his hand and the frogs came up and covered the 
        land. But the magicians did the same things by their secret arts. <br><br>

        Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to the Lord to take 
        the frogs away from me and my people, and I will let your people go.” <br><br>

        Moses cried out to the Lord about the frogs. And the Lord did what 
        Moses asked. The frogs died. They were piled into heaps, and the land 
        reeked of them. <br><br>
        
        When Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and 
        would not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the Lord had said. <br><br>
    </p>
        <img class="profile" src="{% static 'collections/frog.png' %}" alt="">

    <h2>Plague of gnats</h2>
    <p>
        Then the Lord said to Moses, “Tell Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and 
        strike the dust of the ground,’ and throughout the land of Egypt the 
        dust will become gnats.”  <br><br>

        When Aaron stretched out his hand with the staff and struck the dust 
        of the ground, all the dust throughout the land of Egypt became gnats. <br><br>

        But when the magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts, 
        they could not. They said to Pharaoh, “This is the finger of God.” <br><br>
        
        But Pharaoh’s heart was hard and he would not listen, just as the Lord 
        had said. <br><br>
    </p>
        <img class="profile" src="{% static 'collections/gnats.png' %}" alt="">

    <h2>Plague of flies</h2>
    <p>
        Then the Lord said to Moses, “Get up early and say to Pharaoh, 
        ‘Let my people go, so that they may worship God. If you do not let my 
        people go, I will send swarms of flies on you and your officials, 
        on your people and into your houses. <br><br>

        But on that day in the land of Goshen, no swarms of flies will be there, 
        so that you will know that I, the Lord, am in this land. I will make a 
        distinction between my people (the Israelites) and the Egyptians.” <br><br>

        And the Lord did this. Dense swarms of flies poured into Pharaoh’s palace and 
        into the houses of his officials; throughout Egypt the land was ruined 
        by the flies. <br><br>

        Pharaoh said, “I will let you go to offer sacrifices to the Lord your 
        God in the wilderness, but you must not go very far. Now pray for me.” <br><br>

        Then Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the Lord, and the Lord did what 
        Moses asked. But this time also Pharaoh hardened his heart and would 
        not let the people go. <br><br>
    </p>
        <img class="profile" src="{% static 'collections/fly.png' %}" alt="">

    <h2>Plague on livestock</h2>
    <p>
        “If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them back, 
        the hand of the Lord will bring a terrible plague on your livestock 
        in the field—on your horses, donkeys and camels and on your cattle, 
        sheep and goats. <br><br>

        But the Lord will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel 
        and that of Egypt, so that no animal belonging to the Israelites will 
        die.’” <br><br>
        
        And the next day the Lord did it: All the livestock of the Egyptians 
        died, but not one animal belonging to the Israelites died. <br><br>

        Pharaoh investigated and found that not even one of the animals of the 
        Israelites had died. Yet his heart was unyielding and he would not 
        let the people go. <br><br>
