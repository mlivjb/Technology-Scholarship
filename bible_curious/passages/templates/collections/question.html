                    <h2>Origin</h2>
                    <p>Around 3,500 years ago a group of people called the 
                    Israelites (from Israel) lived in Egypt as slaves. The 
                    Egyptian king called Pharaoh was corrupt and sought power. 
                    <br><br>When he realised the Iraelities were becoming too numerous 
                    in his land he sent out an order to kill all the Israelite 
                    baby boys under two in the land. 
                    <br><br> Exodus 2:1-10</p>

                    <h2>Birth of Moses</h2>
                    <p>However an Iraelite mother placed her baby boy in a 
                    basket, covered it with tar so that it would float 
                    down the river. <br><br>She did this in hopes that her son 
                    would be saved from the hand of Pharaoh on her people, 
                    and give him a chance at life. 
                    
                    <br><br>The basket travelled 
                    down the river and made it to the Egyptian palace 
                    where the Egyptian princess found the basket, with the 
                    baby inside. <br><br>Having pity she took him in as her own 
                    and called him 'Moses' which is Hebrew for "I drew him 
                    out of the water."
                    </p>
                    <p class="verse">
                    Exodus 2:6 <br>
                    She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she 
                    felt sorry for him. “This is one of the Hebrew babies,” 
                    she said.
