                    <h1>Who is Moses?</h1>
                    <p>Exodus 1</p>

                    <h2>Origin</h2>
                    <p>Around 3,500 years ago a group of people called the 
                    Israelites (from Israel) lived in Egypt as slaves. The 
                    Egyptian king called Pharaoh was corrupt and sought power. 
                    When he realised the Iraelities were becoming too numerous 
                    in his land he sent out an order to kill all the Israelite 
                    baby boys under two in the land. 
                    <br> Exodus 2:1-10</p>

                    <h2>Birth of Moses</h2>
                    <p>However an Iraelite mother placed her baby boy in a 
                    basket, covered it with tar so that it would float 
                    down the river. She did this in hopes that her son 
                    would be saved from the hand of Pharaoh on her people, 
                    and give him a chance at life. The basket travelled 
                    down the river and made it to the Egyptian palace 
                    where the Egyptian princess found the basket, with the 
                    baby inside. Having pity she took him in as her own 
                    and called him 'Moses' which is Hebrew for "I drew him 
                    out of the water."
                    </p>
                    <p class="verse">
                    Exodus 2:6 <br>
                    She opened it and saw the baby. He was crying, and she 
                    felt sorry for him. “This is one of the Hebrew babies,” 
                    she said.
